                  <p>I am a full stack web developer with experience in Ruby and Javascript frameworks. Through my experience as a high school English teacher for five years, I crafted creative lessons and projects to appeal to a diversity of students and meet their learning goals. My detailed attention to the voice of the consumer, my love of language construction, and my interest in an intuitive and transformative user experience translate seamlessly into the coding world.   </p>
                    <p>When I transitioned to a software engineering student at Flatiron School coding bootcamp, I found another outlet for my creativity by building multifaceted projects using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and React. My resourcefulness and hard work have been essential to ensuring that my projects are carefully planned, implemented, and edited.</p>
